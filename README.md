# HTML-code-refactor

## Project One

This is the first project which details HTMLS refactoring.
I have refactored the code for a marketing agency.I have refactored a code that follows accessibility standards
SO that the website is  optimized for search engines
In order to achieve my goal,I did the following things:
1. Refactored the code and made sure that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
2. Removed all non-semantic elements and added semantic elements.
3. Added accessible alt attributes to img elements.
4. Gave the project a a concise, descriptive title.
5. Added comments  to all the changes that i made.
